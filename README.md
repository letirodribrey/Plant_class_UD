==============
Create two functions in R:

- one being able to train a classifier based on input training data,

- one being able to receive some non-labeled test data and return labels (predictions) for the input data

 

Choose any classifier (and package) you think it's appropriate. Also, write a sample java program to communicate with the R backend (you can use Rserve for this - http://rforge.net/Rserve/). The java program should be able to call the R methods and print the output of the second function (the labels).
